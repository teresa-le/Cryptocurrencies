# Cryptocurrencies Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to find a list of the current cryptocurrencies being traded and group them using unsupervised machine learning. 

## Skills Used 
Python, Unsupervised machine learning (clustering), Data preprocessing 

## Analysis 
In total, there are 532 cryptocurrencies being traded.

Using the elbow curve technique, the ideal number of clusters was found to be 4. The majority of the cryptocurrencies were allocated to cluster 0 and 3.

## Summary 
To expand upon this analysis, more visualizations could be created to determine whether there are other similarities between the cryptocurrencies that belong to the same cluster besides the 'Total Coin Supply' and 'Total Coins Mined.'
